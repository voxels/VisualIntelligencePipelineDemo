On today's episode, I'm going to talk about two rising composers who are amazing, super different, actually go really well together. First is called Edmund Finnis, and he's a British composer that's really starting to generate a name for himself. And although a lot of his music is very beautiful, the one that I want to tell you about is called Devotions. It's made up of eight short pieces of music, and it really tells a story of romantic love, what it feels like, the excitement, but also the tension and mostly the yearning. It puts me into this really beautiful space where things kind of stop, and you're able to just enjoy that feeling. Second composer is called Claire M Singer. The album I've completely fallen in love with is called Solas. The main focus of her works is the organ, but she uses electronic music and string instruments in a way that almost creates this sort of ancient sound. The thing that I find most powerful about this artist is her restraint in the way that she uses these instruments and techniques to create something that feels really natural. Music like Edmund's really gives you that space for yourself. Edmund Finnis, Claire M Singer, two composers that are creating stunning classical music I think you're gonna fall in love with.",
